// Package ovf provides extremely basic functionality for parsing and modifying
// .ovf files.

// TODO: Be advised: Due to the limited scope of the parent project, and a
// limitation in Golang's XML parser, it is not recommend to use this package
// directly unless you know what you are doing. See this GitHub issue for more:
